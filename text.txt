I should have gotten this to you much sooner but circumstances intervened.
Here is the text:
 
For the intro:  let me know if this needs editing down to size.  It’s probably a bit too flourish so I’d appreciate any editing thoughts.
Sometimes it's hard these days to tell the difference between things that once seemed quite distinct.  The designers of Ikea or Death (http://ikeaordeath.com) recently identified an uncanny similarity between the names of flatpack furniture products and death metal bands.  Now musical names have begun to creep into politics. Or is it the other way around?  In May of 2014, Europeans voted both for their favorite political parties and for their favorite pop songs, and the similarities are just too obvious to ignore.  It is unlikely that anybody in 1979 would have confused "the Christian Democratic Party of Italy" (the top European Parliament vote-getter) with "Hallelujah" (the Eurovision-winning song).  But this year we had "We Can" and "Change".  One of them is a song.  One of them is a party.  But which is which? And this is no isolated incident.  Party names sound more like songs and songs sound more like parties.  If you don't believe it, try the following quiz:
 
 
Here are the party/song answers
 
"The River" (To Potami/Το Ποτάμι)is a Greek political party founded by television journalist  Stavros Theodorakis.  It acknowledges not having a clear political profile but leans to the center-left (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_River_%28Greece%29).  Founded in late February 2014, it gained 6.6% in the May 2014 European Parliament election. 

"Party for Everybody" was Russia's entry in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest (www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKNRGc71hjc).  Sung by the Buranovskiye Babushki (The Grannies from Buranovo), it featured a mix of English, Russian and Udmurt and finished in second place with a highly respectable 259 points.

\"There Is a Future\" (Yesh Atid/יֵשׁ עָתִיד) is an Israeli political party founded by television journalist Yair Lapid.  Founded in January 2012, the party gained 14.3% of the vote, becoming the second largest delegation in the Knesset. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesh_Atid)
Voice (\"Vox\") is both a Spanish political party created in December 2013 by former members of the People's Party, receiving 1.6% in the 2014 European Parliament Elections (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_%28Spanish_political_party%29), and  the Swedish entry in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest (La Voix), which despite (or because of) some lightbulb-blowing high notes, received only 33 votes and placed 21st out of 25 competitors (www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WH2OwJeMBE).

\"Ordinary People\" (Obyčajní Ľudia) is a political party in Slovakia created in October 2011 by entrepreneur and maverick parliamentary deputy Igor Matovič which won 8.55% of the vote in Slovakia's March 2010 election, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People_%28Slovakia%29).  Matovič first gained prominence in the 2010 election when he and 3 close colleagues , made skillful use of local media and preference voting to propel themselves from the last 4 places on the list of the Freedom and Solidarity to the top of the list.  They had used the name Ordinary People to describe their grouping but did make the move to transform it into a party until shortly before the election.  On arriving at the Ministry of the Interior, they were informed that another dormant party had earlier that day changed /its/ name to Ordinary People and that the name was therefore taken, forcing Matovič to adopt the name \"Ordinary People and Independent Personages.\"

\"The Way of Courage\" (Drąsos Kelias) is a Lithuanian political party which received 8.3% of the vote in the October 2012 parliamentary election, having been founded in March 2012 by Neringa Venckienė (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Courage).  Venckienė is sister of Drąsius Kedys, who had gained prominence with accusations of a pedophile ring among leading politicians and jurists, and who was found dead under unclear circumstances after being declared a suspect in the murders of two of those he had previously accused.  Venckienė rose to prominence in the aftermath and founded Way of Courage, but she left Lithuania unnanounced in November 2013 rather than face corruption charges and her whereabouts are unknown (though Lithuanian police claim that witnesses have spotted her in Chicago, IL, USA)

\"Rise Up\" was Greece's entry in the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest (www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9y6A1uXLn8).  Sung by Freaky Fortune and featuring RiskyKidd, it received only 35 votes and placed 20th out of 25 songs.  Its video featured a gymnast on a trampoline, causing BBC commentator Martin Faulkner to note that, \"I think they're going for clever choreography, but it risks looking more like bouncy castle playtime at a children's birthday party.\"(http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3D2qkjsfHqkmFDjdCVF93FV/eurovision-song-contest-final-song-reviews).

\"New Tomorrow\" was Denmark's entry in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest (www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_fFy5Icbh0).  Sung by the band, \"A Friend in London\", it gained 134 points and a respectable 5th place showing.  The song almost belongs in the \"Both\" category as it was used in 2013 as the campaign song of Malta's Labour Party (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88EFGgqKxeY).

\"Something Better\" was Finland's entry in the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest (www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FDWaFfo1CU).  Sung by Softengine, the song gained 72 points and an 11th place showing.

\"Dawn\" is the name of a number of political parties, most recently Dawn of Direct Democracy (Úsvit přímé demokracie), founded in June 2013 by Czech-Japanese entrepreneur and senator Tomio Okamua, which gained 6.9% of the vote in the October 2013 elections (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_Direct_Democracy); the name is also used by Greece's far-right \"Golden Dawn\" (Chrysí Avgí/Χρυσή Αυγή which is not new but rapidly transformed from minor political player to a strong candidate in Greece's 2012 elections (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_%28political_party%29); the name is also used by \"Dawn\" (Úsvit) a minor political splinter from the Slovak Communist Party.

\"Change\" was Romania's entry in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest (www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q1WpOTpZ1A).  Sung by Hotel FM, the song gained 77 points and a 17th place showing, receiving the coveted \"douze points\" (twelve points) not only from neighboring Moldova but also from Italy.

\"We Can\" (Podemos) is a Spanish political party led by writer and political commentator Pablo Iglesias Turrión and citing as its inspiration the Greek left-wing party SYRIZA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_%28Spanish_political_party%29).  Although founded in January of 2014, It received 8.0% in theMay 2014 European Parliament elections. 

\"I Believe\" (Verjamem) is both a Slovenian political party founded by Igor Šoltes, a lawyer and former president of Slovenia's audit court--founded in the spring of 2014 it managed 10.5% in the May 2014 European Parliament elections--and Slovenia's entry in the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest sung by Eva Boto--gaining 31 points and a 17th place finish.  In the first weeks of the founding of the /party/, internet searches in both Slovene and English pointed almost exclusively to the /song/.
 
 
Here’s for the last page.  I thought maybe taking the names of the songs out of the picture and justlisting it in the text here but I’m open to anything.  This all probably needs a lot of editing as well.  Just let me know what you need from me
 
So what's the point?  Well there are to obvious ones and one that takes a bit of getting used to.  First the obvious ones:
If you're founding a new party, you need only look to the recent Eurovision contests for a name.  Here's a starter list: "There Must Be Another Way", "Wolves ofthe Sea", "Identity", "My Dream", "Coming Home", "My Little Horse".   p.s. While you are at it, see if you can find a well-respected television psychologist to serve as the face of the party).
If you've written a mediocre pop song and and just can't find a title, check out Europe's electoral roster (""Message of Hope", "99%", "Yes", "Enough", "Attack", "The Net", "I'm Not Paying"; if you need more, see http://politicaldatayearbook.com where my co-editors at the Political Data Yearbook, and I have tried to provide a complete list).
And how the prosaic political-science point (I know, IkeaOrDeath didn't preach at you, but frankly parties are a bit more important than pressboard lampstands).
This isn't just about party and song names but about how our politics is changing.  Organizations in all walks of life seem less-rooted, more flexible, more apt to change.  And boundaries--between genres, between substance and self-promotion, between fiction and reality--seem ever more porous.  This may just be an illusion--every generation in modernity sees itself as moving faster than its predecessors--but there are good reasons to think that things /are/ changing  (See Clay Shirkey's /Here Comes Everybody/, http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/22/society1, and Moises Naim's /The End of Power/, http://bit.ly/naim-review-lse) If so, the questions facing of citizens becomes much more critical and difficult.  How do we decide between compromised experience and unsullied novelty?  How do we hold politicians accountable if they themselves really don't expect to be around by the next election?

Thanks to Tim Haughton, Tereza Novotna, Zsolt Enyedi, Rainbow Murray, and Andreas Bagenholm for their encouragement.  Thanks to my wife Bridget and children Elena and Peter for the seeds of the idea.  And thanks to Graham Hukill of Wayne State University's Office of Teaching and Learning for the fantastic work on implementing this rather odd idea.
Kevin Deegan-Krause is an Associate Professor of Political Science at Wayne State University, co-editor of the European Consortium for Political Research Political Data Yearbook, and occasional blogger at http://www.pozorblog.com.  He is proud of his obsession with political parties and slightly embarrassed by his obsession with the Eurovision Song Contest.  Or is it the other way around?
